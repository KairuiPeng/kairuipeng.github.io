                        <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="10ms">Since 2017, as a student at the Communication
                            University of China, one of the top universities in media studies, I gained a solid
                            foundation in digital media technical and theoretical skills. I learned all kinds of digital
                            media software, including Final Cut Pro, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe AE, Adobe Illustration, 3D
                            Maya, Unity, and to interpret the art of videos and special effects with digital synthesis,
                            both of which enabled me to understand and create visual aesthetics with digital art.
                            Further, Motivated by Professor Vincenzo De Mazi, I engaged in the tourism promotion of
                            small walled cities in northern Italy; we took a study trip to Veneto and made a
                            documentary. During summer 2018 and 2019, we visited more than five cities in Veneto within
                            a week and learned their histories and cultures and recorded what we observed and
                            experienced into a documentary with VR and 4D technology. Our documentary was selected into
                            the 2019 and 2020 Venice Film Festival, receiving beyond the millions of views.</p>
                        <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="50ms">In 2019, I interned at the Danish Chamber of
                            Commerce in China (DCCC) where I utilised my bilingual oral and written communication skills
                            by writing and designing promotional videos, websites, and mobile applications. My efforts
                            have contributed to a follower growth rate of 2% within 6 months on DCCC WeChat account.</p>

                            At the beginning of 2020, when China was suffering from the COVID-19 outbreak, I was
                            travelling in Sichuan and Tibet with two Danish colleagues to film a documentary “<i>Song of
                                Chinese Frontiers</i>”. The documentary project turned out to be a road-trip through
                            fear,
                            rumours, and virus. It presented how bustling streets turned empty and how cities prevented
                            the virus. When everyone quarantined at home, I captured meaningful scenes to show what was
                            happening in the almost secluded places. I earned some donations and assistance to the
                            cities.

                            In the mid-2020, I interned at a Liangjie Culture Media Co., Ltd. In Beijing, China, where I
                            participated in the planning of a Young Director Film Festival competition, a display of
                            films created by students. I leveraged my communication skills to liaise with over twenty
                            domestic and overseas universities. To everyone’s content, the festival gathered over 3,000
                            daily online views. The students showed unanimous appreciation, and I realised how eager
                            they were to present their work, communicate with peers, and learn new skills and ideas.

                            Instead of limiting my experience to traditional motion pictures, I strived to gain fresh
                            insights from digital media companies. In August 2020, I won a competitive opportunity to
                            intern for Tik Tok Vietnam version. There, I collaborated with an international team and
                            strengthened my team-building skills. I have designed 20+ stickers and 30+ banners within
                            four months, designed the HTML5 promotional page in the mobile app’s “Discover” column,
                            achieving an average of 300,000 clicks for each H5 page and banner. I also conducted
                            diversified labelling for videos and posters with over one million subscribers, created
                            “hashtag” challenges such as #learnontiktok and resulted in over 600,000 views.

                        <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="250ms">
                            Above all, I used to voluntarily teach basic photography skills to children ages 10-15 in
                            Ufa, Russia, in the year 2019. The sparkle in the children’s eyes has stayed with me as I
                            navigate my professional journey. I aim to establish an art education institution to help
                            students in China and across the world study digital media technologies including
                            photographing, filming, editing and short-video making. I hope to leverage my knowledge and
                            skills to help others in need and to expand the positive influence of media. I would share
                            my experiences of different cultures with students and encourage them to apply what they
                            learn to film their experiences, express their innermost world, and contribute to their
                            communities.
